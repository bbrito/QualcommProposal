\section{Innovation Proposal and Relation to The State of The Art}\label{related_work}

Unfortunately, most state-of-the-art planners do not model the interaction between traffic participants. The first innovation will be

in crowded environments many different
motion plans exist (see Figure2-left) and exploring them all is prohibitive, and b) humans
do not explicitly communicate with the robots.


1) a massive amount of pre-computed optimal motions are generated offline and compressed into a ``memory of motion''.
2) these trajectories are recovered during execution and adapted to new situations with real-time model predictive control.
This allows generalization to dynamically changing environments.
3) available sensor modalities (vision, inertial, 3D-Lidar) are exploited for feedback control which goes beyond the basic robot
state with a focus on adaptive behavior.
